            More than a job, Product Management and Product Design is an outlet
            for my vision. I have the power to take an idea from concept to
            reality. Nothing beats the rush of seeing my product in action.

            I get to blend art and technology to create "digital experiences"
            that inform, entertain, and inspire. <br /> Every day is different;
            one day I may be sketching site layouts on paper, the next I am
            designing responsive page templates. The Product field keeps me on
            my toes!
